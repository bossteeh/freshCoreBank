# freshCoreBank

Project CoreBank is a bank that promotes ease of banking. I created a website using HTML and SASS with a little bit of animation.

It's my first time working with animations so the animations I used are playful and not exactly professional. 

The live website design can be previewed at : <a href="https://freshcorebankdesign.netlify.app" target="_blank" style="color:green"> Project Corebank </a>
